/* In this task, you have a box, which contains another box. Your task is to
make the inner box 60% of the width of the outer box. The value of the box-sizing
property is set to border-box, which means that the total width includes any
padding and border. You should also give the inner box padding of 10% using the
width (or inline size) as the size from which that percentage is calculated. */

/* The container is 400 pixels wide. The student is asked to make the box 60
percent of the container and to give it 10% of padding on all sides. All
elements already have box-sizing: border-box to save the student worrying
about which width they are using, and this is explained in the task instruction. */
